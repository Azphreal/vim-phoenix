# Phoenix Colorscheme for Vim

Monochrome Vim colorscheme based on [Phoenix](https://github.com/netatoo/phoenix-theme).

## A Couple of Notes

- Terminal is not supported yet
- Not entirely monochrome for improved usability (e.g. errors are red, diffs are green, yellow and red)

Pull requests welcome.
